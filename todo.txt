update to most recently updated raylib stuff, makes things easier.

need to make it so that when you select the grid thing, it shows a faint grid and whatnot.

then it goes to create point mode

also, mode 1 is just point manipulation

alrighty, we need to be able to select multiple points. also, make point selection not random lmao.

yeah we gonna start making faces :D:D:D:D


also, make the point radius an actual variable pls...

okey... i wanna make faces.

5/24 - todo:
-replace literal values with variables (like BLACK to LINE_COLOR for example)
-decide on a contral scheme and gui
-ability to multiple points at the same time
-fix y-axis mode 2 thing where it doesn't expand when you get to the bottom of it
-make every variable changable like having point size and whatnot be modifiable
-also, be able to flag on or off whether you can see faces or points or whatever
-possibly make faces transparent or something?
-fix multiple points in same place (make 2 points and move one to bcheck this)
