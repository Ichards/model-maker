update to most recently updated raylib stuff, makes things easier.

need to make it so that when you select the grid thing, it shows a faint grid and whatnot.

then it goes to create point mode

also, mode 1 is just point manipulation

alrighty, we need to be able to select multiple points. also, make point selection not random lmao.

yeah we gonna start making faces :D:D:D:D


also, make the point radius an actual variable pls...

okey... i wanna make faces.

5/24 - todo:
-replace literal values with variables (like BLACK to LINE_COLOR for example)
-decide on a contral scheme and gui
-ability to multiple points at the same time
-fix y-axis mode 2 thing where it doesn't expand when you get to the bottom of it
-make every variable changable like having point size and whatnot be modifiable
-also, be able to flag on or off whether you can see faces or points or whatever
-possibly make faces transparent or something?
+fix multiple points in same place (make 2 points and move one to bcheck this) (6/9/2022)

6/7 - thoughts:
i have a rough idea for how i'd like the program to be set up.
everything starts with a point, and the already implemented grid system rigamaroo is fine for that ig
however, points should be able to be made in relation to other points.
for example, you should be able to select a point and make another point that's down the x axis from it, for example.
Or, you could go down the x axis and make a psuedopoint and use it as a reference to make the real point (or continue making "pseudopoints")
another idea is being able to make points using a selected point as a center and making new one's at a certain angle from the center with a certain radius and whatnot
note:
-trying to fix the multiple points issue has led me to the conclusion that floats are stupid and should be replaced or something.
-maybe floats aren't a big problem but i'd like better precision. i can just use epsilon to compare for now however

6/11 - thoughts:
the size of points should be based on how they far away they are from the camera; basically,they're a constant size
control scheme will be:
mouse + QWEASD keys + space. Q+A will be used to go back and forth in one axis, and so on. space shifts modes
modes:
0. blank
1. modify points mode (single or multiple points)
2. create new point mode (absolute)
3. create noew point mode (relative to other single point)
4. create face (multiple points)

blank (0 points selected) (space)-> 2 --> blank
blank (1 point selected) (space)-> 3 --> blank
blank (1 point selected) = 1 --> blank/1
blank (multiple points selected) (space)-> 4
blank (multiple points selected) = 1

-> = transition to new "mode"
= mode is already implied
--> = you do whatever and eventually end up transitioning after you do what you need to
